# Light SCSS Semtanic.gs

## What the hell is this?
This is SCSS only light [**Semantic.gs**](https://github.com/twigkit/semantic.gs/) repo, with changes made by [bhcarpenter](https://github.com/bhcarpenter) that didn't enter official repo yet. 

All rights reserved for [bhcarpenter](https://github.com/bhcarpenter) and [twigkit](https://github.com/twigkit).

## Changes
1. Fixes the nested column problem (yes, it was still happening).
2. Updates calculations of row width and push/pull margin size to match what I think the correct behavior should be.
3. Cleans up the calculations so that they are easier to understand.

All changes were integrated from this [**PULL**](https://github.com/twigkit/semantic.gs/pull/63) request.
